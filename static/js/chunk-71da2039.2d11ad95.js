The returning members will initiate the Cohesion, connecting the minds of all the beings. The data is shared amongst the group and preserved for eternity. Lights bright enough to cover the entire Nexus filled the space. The sudden anomaly draws the attention of the entire group. There is something different about the new rift that opened... They could sense it. The subtle but definite auras and the vigorous lifeforce. This galaxy is neither the most advanced nor the most primitive, resting in the middle of its development. Yet, there was something special about it.This would be the first full expedition of the beings since the dawn of their existence. Never has there been an expedition where all 200 have been dispatched. They gathered all their resources and stepped through the rift into the new world...The LYNKVERSE was boundless with lands and oceans stretching further than the eye can see. They could sense the existence of the ones they seek in different places across the lands. They landed in the great plain where the existence of a great civilization used to be… The signal was sent out, a radiant beam stretching high into the sky.

Then, natural disasters struck on a scale never seen before. The Keepers were forced to evacuate the inhabitants of Sanctuary to keep them safe. They split into groups and were separated. In the aftermath of the disasters, the landscape changed and was completely unrecognizable. Lands became oceans and rivers became valleys. The Keepers tried valiantly to find and rebuild the sanctuary but they failed. Even locating the other groups proved to be impossible. They settled down to rebuild their lives in the new environments they found themselves in. The 4 groups thus began anew in their respective new territories. In the Northern Isles, the seasons changed faster than usual. The Keepers studied the patterns of nature and became in tune with it. Over time, they learned to manipulate the elements to their will… To the West, the tropics were home to a myriad of wild creatures who saw these new arrivals as nothing but food. The Keepers picked up their arms with determination to protect those under their charge. The battles honed their skills to the point of mastery... The Eastern caves were bizarre - the laws of physics were warped. The flow of time was erratic and space was distorted. Upon arrival, the Keepers were disoriented by the fluctuations in spacetime. In time, they learned the new laws of spacetime and could wield them like mages... The Southern cliffs had split and revealed an ancient secret. The Keepers found the ruins of an ancient civilization possessing technology far beyond current times. As they studied the texts and artifacts, their knowledge increased rapidly and their intelligence soared... Time passed and the Keepers and their groups carried on with their lives, but there was not a single moment where everyone did not think and reminisce about the glory of the Sanctuary and their community members... A beam of light shot into the sky. It was so radiant that every corner of LYNKVERSE was illuminated by this light. Everyone in the North, South, East, and West territories knew something had happened. Every group sent out an expedition to find out what happened. Following the direction of the light, the groups arrived at a massive plain. In the center of the light, incredible auras were radiating. The next thing they saw was the others.
